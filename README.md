C.O.M.E.T.
Problem: Traffic is a rising problem, especially in developing countries with rising population levels. It is a problem that plagues all sectors of society. Many people cannot afford the luxury of changing their location for their jobs and have very long commute times to their jobs. Improving roads is one solution, but it is expensive and requires a huge time commitment. Introducing the C.O.M.E.T. (Congestion Overlooking Metropolitan Electronic Tracker). COMET is an app that tracks the number of cars (through machine learning) and returns a graph which helps to illustrate the number of vehicles/second. 

How we believe it can scale and have an impact: Google maps obviously seems very similar to COMET (displaying traffic times). However, there are some differences. COMET is instantaneous while google maps does take time to adjust road timings and it will not always be on top of whether a road is completely congested or not. Google maps also does not show real time in all areas. COMET relies on camera footage in order to track the number of cars. While it may seem expensive to use cameras at traffic junctions, several countries use cameras for various functions in other countries1. We would ideally want to work with the government for the implementation of COMET at Bangalore, and then India and other heavily congested areas in need for less congestion.

Code complexity: Python, Tkinter (for GUI), OpenCV and Haar Cascades (for algorithm and machine learning), Matplotlib (for graphs)
